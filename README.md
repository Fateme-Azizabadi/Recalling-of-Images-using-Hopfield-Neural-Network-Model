**Recalling of Images using Hopfield Neural Network Model**

**In the project, an effort has been made for storing and recalling images with Hopfield Neural Network**

We read train data from the input.

We train the Hopfield network. That is, we feed each pattern to the network, obtain the weight matrix and normalize the matrix to improve the results. How to train the network is explained in the code file.

The matrix of weights and network results are given below.

Then we add noise to the images and train the network with these noisy images.
